## ⭐ STAR Method Breakdown

### **S — Situation**
Airline operations teams needed a centralized analytical solution to monitor daily operations, flight performance, route efficiency, and passenger trends. The raw dataset included flights, carriers, airports, distance groups, load factors, and more.

### **T — Task**
Design an advanced multi-page Power BI dashboard that provides:
- Real-time operational insights
- Route-level intelligence
- Passenger analytics
- Trend analysis
- Drill-through and interactive visuals
- Executive-ready KPIs

### **A — Action**
- Cleaned & transformed 110k rows using Power Query
- Built 5 dashboards: Operations, Flight Management, Routes, Analytics, Passengers
- Developed advanced DAX measures (On-Time Rate, Load Factor, Route KPIs, Passenger Growth)
- Designed unique visual elements: Ribbon Charts, Waterfall, Decomposition Tree, Maps, Treemaps
- Implemented left navigation pane with branding + page consistency
- Applied conditional formatting, slicers, drill-through filters, and dynamic KPIs



### **R — Result**
- Identified highest passenger route: ATL–LGA with 601K passengers
- Highlighted the highest missed flights: National Carriers (4,018)
- Showed Domestic flights dominance (86.21%)
- Determined the peak year: 2011, and highest quarterly growth: 0.61M in Q2
Delivered a decision-ready analytics system that improved visibility, highlighted operational inefficiencies, and supported strategic route planning.

## 🔄 Multi-Tool Implementation (Internship Project)

This project was built as part of my **Data Analytics Internship**, where I performed end-to-end analysis using multiple tools:

| Tool         | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
